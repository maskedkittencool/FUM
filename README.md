## Can I get my own packages on FUM?

Absolutely! DM "maskedkittenluvsu" on discord and send your package, and what you want the name, description and author name to be! I may take a while to respond, I have school, and I dont have time to just add packages, lol.

## What if I have a outdated version of UFM and / or a outdated version of a package?

No worrys! Both UFM and every package has a updater, whenever a new version is uploaded it will automatically update for you!

## How frequently will updates release?

Not very frequently, I would guess atleast 1 every month! could be more, i dont know :)
